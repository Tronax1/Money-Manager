# Money-Manager
A finance web application
## Features
This is a full stack application that helps the user keep track of expenses, it also has a 
mortgage calculator to determine what the house payments per month would be given a down payment, and
interest rate. The application also displays whether the user is overspending given the income, as well
as the expenses. Last but not least, it shows the current value of a stock given by user input.
## Approach
We used React for the front end, Redux for state management and Firebase for the back end database as well as
user authentication. Whenever a user is created, Redux handles the requests with Firebase to successfully create an account, and whenever a user inputs an expense, Redux sends the data to the real time database.
## What did we learn?
We learned how to use Redux in conjunction with React to create a full stack web application with the help of
the real time database, and authentication provided by Firebase.
